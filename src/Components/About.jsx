         <p className="text-3xl font-serif py-10 hover:text-pink-300">My name is Sujitha, and I am currently in my second year of pursuing a BSc in Computer Science at Ethiraj College. I have a deep passion for the IT sector and am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in this dynamic field.</p>

        <p className="text-3xl font-serif py-6 hover:text-pink-300">Throughout my academic journey, I have gained a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java and Python. I am also proficient in working with relational databases, including RDBMS, PHP, and MySQL. My interest in web development has led me to learn the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and I am skilled in using front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS to build responsive and user-friendly websites.</p>

         <p className="text-3xl font-serif py-6 hover:text-pink-300">As a second-year student, I am excited to apply my theoretical knowledge in real-world projects and further develop my technical skills. I am actively seeking internship opportunities or part-time roles that will allow me to contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with professionals, and gain hands-on experience in the IT industry. My passion for learning and solving complex problems motivates me to stay updated with the latest technologies and trends.</p>
